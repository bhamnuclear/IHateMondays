IHM V1.0 J. Bishop Dec. 2020
IHM = I Hate Mondays
Uses GARFIELD++ to calculate coefficients needed for TexAtSim/TeBATSim
You should install GARFIELD++ locally - https://garfieldpp.web.cern.ch/garfieldpp/getting-started/

To set up GARFIELD - add the following to your system paths

export GARFIELD_HOME = /home/jeb/garfield/garfieldpp/install
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jeb/garfield/garfieldpp/install/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Compile with makefile and execute with ./IHM
Then input either single or double gas
Then name of gas (and ratio and second gas/ratio)
Enter pressure in Torr
Then enter FC voltage
Negative inputs here instead calculate the electric field strength in V/cm and bypass the conversion from volts->V/cm
The program will then give you drift velocity and position/time resolution
